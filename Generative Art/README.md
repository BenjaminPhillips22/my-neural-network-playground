### Generative Art by Gradient Descent

I created a pytorch Model with a specified number of (x,y) coordinates. The model doesn't take any input. The points are split into a number of groups. The objective function rewards points staying close together and also rewards groups that are distanced from each other. Playing of the coefficients of group closeness, inter-group distance and number of points/groups creates different behaviour.

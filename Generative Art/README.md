### Generative Art by Gradient Descent

I created a pytorch Model with a specified number of (x,y) coordinates. The model doesn't take any input. The points are split into a number of groups. The objective function rewards points staying close together and also rewards groups that are distanced from each other. Playing of the coefficients of group closeness, inter-group distance and number of points/groups creates different behaviour.

View `code.py` for the code used the create the gifs below or you can run it on [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kGi0N8FW0_XeFEON0VdCEjiISybbuLAO).

Another project I worked on aimed to create art based roughly on how the planets interact, with the ability to play around with different parameters such as gravity. You can view the jupyter notebook or check out the [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ldw9tUKjeNcG5ZMDGSOZx9l_C6msxoA4)
